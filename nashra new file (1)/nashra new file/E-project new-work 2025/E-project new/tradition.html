       <h2>Turkish Tea</h2>
<p>Turkish tea, known as <strong>“çay”</strong> in Turkish, is one of the most important parts of daily life in Turkey. Unlike other countries where tea is just a beverage, in Turkey it’s a cultural tradition that has been passed down through generations. Turkish tea is prepared using a special double teapot called a <strong>çaydanlık</strong>. The top part holds strong tea concentrate, while the bottom holds boiling water. People can adjust the strength of their tea by mixing both parts in their glass.</p>

<p>The tea is always served in small, tulip-shaped clear glasses. These glasses are designed to keep the tea hot while showing its deep red color. Sugar is usually added according to personal taste, but milk is never used. Turkish tea is most often made from black tea grown in the lush Rize region near the Black Sea.</p>

<p>People in Turkey drink tea many times a day — early in the morning, during work breaks, and in the evening with family or friends. It is served during meetings, conversations, and even business deals. In fact, Turkey is one of the highest tea-consuming countries in the world.</p>

<p>There are also special types of tea like <strong>apple tea</strong> and <strong>herbal teas</strong>, but traditional black tea remains the most loved. Preparing the perfect cup of Turkish tea is considered an art, and many people take pride in making it just right.</p>

        <h3> Dondurma (Turkish Ice Cream)</h3>
        <p>Turkish Ice Cream, known as "Dondurma", is famous not only for its unique taste but also for its chewy, stretchy texture. Unlike regular ice cream, it doesn’t melt quickly and takes longer to eat!

It’s made from goat milk, sugar, and two special ingredients:
 Salep – a flour made from orchid root
 Mastic – a plant resin that gives it a stretchy texture

What makes it even more fun is the performance of ice cream vendors!spinning cones, and making you chase your ice cream before handing it over.

This playful tradition makes buying dondurma a fun experience, </p>
